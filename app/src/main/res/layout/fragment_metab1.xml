As the Me Too movement gained more attention, it led several states to prohibit the use of confidentiality agreements in sexual harassment cases. With more recognition, a group of women in Hollywood started a charity and have raised over 24 million dollars since 2018 - this has led to over 3,900 women getting legal support for their cases. The Me Too movement gave courage to many women to finally come out and speak their truth and take down their abusers. "

            android:text="      The movement began to change the world after many men in the entertainment industry were accused by numerous women of sexual harassment. Many people were surprised at the magnitude of women that had gone through these traumatic experiences but even more appalled at how many men have gotten away with it. Important men in power were being taken down because of the heinous acts they committed. For example, Larry Nasar, former doctor for the USA gymnastics team, was accused by 250 women of sexual harassment and was sentenced to 175 years. While justice is being served for many women, many accused abusers still walk free to this day. Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexually harassing Stanford professor Christine Ford and was still voted in to be a supreme court justice. Because of this, people began changing their views about the purity of people in power. "

Countries such as France, Nigeria, Australia, India, and many more have started to speak out about their experiences of sexual harassment. In France after Roman Polanski, a film director, was accused of raping many underage girls, the younger generation of women refused to stay silent and shared their stories of being sexually assaulted and catcalled, which was common in the streets of France. In Nigeria, women started a hashtag #Sex4Grades, because they were being forced to have sexual relations with professors for better grades. With the built up anger of thousands of cases that were not filed or fought against, the MeToo movement has been one of the biggest revolutions in Indian history, with thousands of women sharing their traumatic experiences. In many countries women are afraid to speak up because they are not protected by freedom of speech, however, the Me Too movement helped make it more acceptable for women to speak out in those countries."
